# Internship Project: Multimodal Artificial Intelligence for In-Vehicle Activity Detection

At Stellantis (formerly PSA Group)
ðŸ”’ Full research materials are available upon request. Contact me at jeremyjaspar2@gmail.com or on LinkedIn.

This project aims to design and implement a smart in-vehicle activity detection system using multimodal deep learning, combining facial recognition and speaker identification to enhance user interaction and personalization.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started: Smart System for Activity Detection (SSAD)

Follow these steps to register a user and launch the detection system.

ðŸ”¹ Step 1 â€“ Face Registration (FaceSignIn)
Capture and register multiple images of a user's face:
`python FaceSignIn.py`

ðŸ”¹ Step 2 â€“ Voice Registration (VoiceSignIn)
Record and register multiple samples of the user's voice:
`python VoiceSignIn.py`

ðŸ”¹ Step 3 â€“ Launch SSAD System
Start the full multimodal detection system:
`python main.py`
